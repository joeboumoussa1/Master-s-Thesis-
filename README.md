**Overview
This project analyzes whether federal appropriations aimed at mitigating the U.S. opioid crisis have been effective in reducing accidental opioid overdose deaths. Using state‑level data from SAMHSA, the CDC, HUD, and FRED, the study evaluates the relationship between federal spending and overdose mortality through an econometric framework.
The findings show a small increase in overdose deaths following increases in federal funding, suggesting structural issues in how resources are allocated and implemented. The thesis also provides historical context on the three waves of the opioid epidemic, reviews scientific consensus on addiction as a disease, and assesses federal policy responses across agencies.**

Key Features
- Econometric modeling of overdose mortality using panel data
- State‑level dataset combining public health, socioeconomic, and policy variables
- Analysis of federal appropriations from SAMHSA and HHS
- Historical and policy review of the opioid epidemic
- Interpretation of model results and discussion of policy implications

Data Sources
• 	CDC WONDER – Accidental opioid overdose deaths
• 	SAMHSA – Substance abuse and mental health funding
• 	HUD Exchange – Homelessness data
• 	FRED (St. Louis Fed) – Unemployment and per‑capita income
• 	N‑SSATS – Substance abuse treatment facility counts
• 	IQVIA Xponent – Naloxone distribution rates

Methods
- Fixed‑effects panel regression
- Robust standard errors
- Multivariate controls including income, unemployment, homelessness, treatment access, and naloxone distribution
- Policy‑driven variable selection based on literature

Main Findings
- Federal appropriations correlate with a small increase in overdose mortality.
- Results suggest implementation inefficiencies rather than funding insufficiency.
- Structural issues in treatment access, policy design, and institutional practices likely weaken the impact of federal spending.
